Welcome to Sirius Panda by [Panda](https://github.com/pandahackervc)!

This is my personal tech blog. I use it to write notes, document what I learn, and think out loud about tools, systems, and ideas I’m exploring.

The posts are intentionally simple—mostly Markdown. Tags grow organically as topics evolve. No content calendar. No hype. Just things I find worth writing down.

If something here helps you think better or build faster, great. If not, that’s fine too.

Enjoy reading. Or don’t. Build something instead.

Enjoy!
